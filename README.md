A Golang tool to fabricate and manipulate ERC 4337 UserOperations for Ethereum blockchains

v0.1.0:  The first version that actually let you import your ABI's, define your UserOperation, sign it (ECDSA, imported private key only atm), and export the UserOperation as a Remix-compatible tuple / Bundler standard JSON.
Still a lot to do...
